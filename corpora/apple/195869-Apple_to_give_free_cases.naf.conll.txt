Apple to give free cases , refunds to iPhone 4 owners
July 17 , 2010
Apple Inc. announced Friday that it will give owners of its new iPhone 4 a free case in response to mounting concerns over the device 's antenna placement .
The iPhone 4 antenna is actually a metal strip that wraps around the side of the device , which has caused dropped calls when held in a certain way .
The announcement came in a rare press conference held by Apple on Friday morning .
During the event , company CEO Steve Jobs attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone 's antenna .
Rather than recall the devices or offer a hardware fix , Jobs said yesterday that Apple will offer a free case to anyone who has purchased an iPhone 4.
The rubber cases , or " bumpers " , wrap around the side of an iPhone and have been found to alleviate the reception issues .
Apple 's bumpers were priced at US $ 29 before the press conference , but will be free to anyone with an iPhone 4 until September 30 .
Jobs also said that those who had already purchased a bumper will receive a full refund for the accessory .
