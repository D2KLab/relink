Apple introduces new iPod with video playback capabilities
October 13 , 2005
On Wednesday , Apple introduced an iPod capable of displaying video , as well as a new video section to the iTunes music store .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs believes that this may have a large impact on the film industry , in a similar fashion to that of the impact on the music industry when the iPod first was released .
The new iPod comes in a 30GB edition and a 60GB edition for US$ 299 and US$ 399 , respectively .
On the 30GB iPod , 75 hours of video at a resolution of 320x240 can be stored , and on the 60GB iPod , 150 hours can be stored .
Despite these features , people claim that the screen may be too small for people to enjoy .
However , iPod owners will be able to purchase an optional S-Video cable for playing video from their iPod on a television .
To help complement the new video section , Apple and ABC have agreed to a deal in which episodes of television programs such as Lost and Desperate Housewives will be available the day after airing for $ 1.99 per episode .
Other plans for the video section involve the animation company Pixar , which was founded by current Apple CEO Steve Jobs .
