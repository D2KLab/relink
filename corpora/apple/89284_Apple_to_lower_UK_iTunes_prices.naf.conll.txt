Apple to lower UK iTunes prices
January 09 , 2008
The European Commission has forced Apple Inc. to lower its prices for media in its United Kingdom iTunes store , Apple 's online media shop .
The change in policy will occur within the next six months , Apple announced this morning .
Apple is the producer of the world 's most-sold MP3 Player , the iPod and launched the iTunes Music Store , a online music store , on April 28 , 2003 .
The store was renamed to iTunes Store in 2006 , as Apple began selling other media apart from music , such as feature-length movies .
Since its launch the store has sold more than 3 billion songs .
At the moment songs are sold for # 0.79 per song and # 7.99 per album which after the price cut will on average be reduced to # 0.74 and # 7.48 to match the EU prices of $ 0.99 and $ 9.99 , according to Times Online .
The price decrease follows an investigation by the European Commission due to Apple charging customers in the UK up to 10 % more than in other EU countries .
According to The Register , Apple will be demanding that the record labels lower their prices in the UK in respect to this forced price cut .
