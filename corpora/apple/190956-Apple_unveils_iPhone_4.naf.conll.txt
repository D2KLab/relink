Apple unveils iPhone 4 , iOS 4 at Worldwide Developers Conference 2010
June 8 , 2010
Yesterday , at this year 's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) , company CEO Steve Jobs unveiled iPhone 4 , along with the new iOS 4 operating system for Apple mobile devices .
The announcement was long-awaited but not a very big surprise .
In April , the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online .
While introducing iPhone 4 , at the annual conference , Jobs started by hinting at the incident , saying , " Stop me if you 've already seen this . "
The new iPhone was praised by Jobs as " the biggest leap we 've taken since the original iPhone . "
It is only 9.3 millimetres ( 0.37 inches ) thick , making it " the thinnest smartphone on the planet " , a 24 percent reduction from Apple 's previous model , the iPhone 3GS .
Structure-wise , iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame , which acts as an antenna , supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls .
It also has a new screen , dubbed a " retina display , " which displays images at 326 pixels per inch .
