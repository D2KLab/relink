Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs on medical leave
January 17 , 2011
Steve Jobs , the chief executive officer of Apple Inc., announced Monday in an internal memo that he would be on medical leave for an undetermined period of time .
The statement caused a sharp decrease of Apple share prices in foreign markets , while US markets were closed in honor of Martin Luther King .
Monday 's email announcement marked the third time in the past decade that Jobs , aged 55 , has taken medical leave .
He fought pancreatic cancer in 2004 and took six months off in early 2009 , later revealing he had undergone a liver transplant .
Jobs has not yet mentioned what prompted his decision this time around , but said he will still be the company 's CEO .
He left current chief operating officer Timothy D. Cook in charge of day-to-day operations , the same move made in Jobs ' last two absences .
While no additional comment has been officially made by Apple , The New York Times reported that someone familiar with the situation said Jobs 's health has " ups and downs " due to problems with his immune system , problems frequently experienced by those who have had liver transplants .
The insider , who asked to remain anonymous , said that , over the past few weeks , Jobs ' health appeared to be deteriorating and that he was becoming thinner .
