Apple swamped by iPhone 4 pre-orders
June 16 , 2010
Pre-orders of the recently announced iPhone 4 began Tuesday , overwhelming Apple and AT&T .
Many buyers experienced issues connecting to Apple 's website and customer service line .
Some had difficulty finishing their orders online , while others endured long waits at Apple 's retail stores due to the online issues .
Some customers reported that Apple had set a recording on their phone lines telling people to call back at a later time , and others even tweeted about their experience .
Since the original iPhone was released in 2007 , web servers for both Apple and AT&T have experienced issues at every new device launch .
Today 's glitches were apparently in the transaction authorization process , the point when Apple transfers information over to AT&T servers .
Other retailers , including Best Buy and Radio Shack , did not appear to be having the same problems .
Representatives at several Apple Stores in the United States said that buyers should try again tomorrow .
