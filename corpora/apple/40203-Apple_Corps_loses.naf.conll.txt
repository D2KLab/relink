Apple Corps loses court case against Apple Computer
May 8 , 2006
The Beatles ' label Apple Corps lost its court case against Apple Computer today in the High Court .
Apple Corps argued that the iTunes Music Store was a breach of the 1991 settlement reached between the two parties .
The 1991 agreement was that Apple Computer would not sell music branded with an apple .
Mr Justice Anthony Mann agreed with Apple Computer 's defence that , while the iTunes Music Store is branded , the music it sells is not - " I conclude that the use of the Apple logo ... does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work . "
During the case Apple Corps showed the court just how many times the Apple Computer logo appeared during a typical download .
The song purchased during the demonstration was Le Freak by Chic .
After the case closed Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs extended an invitation to the record label , " we have always loved the Beatles , and hopefully we can now work together to get them on the iTunes Music Store " .
Apple Corps have decided to take the case to the Court of Appeal .
