Apple releases program to limit iPod volume
April 5 , 2006
Apple has released an application that limits the volume produced from its iPod portable music players .
The software update , iPod Software 1.1.1 , works with the iPod Nano and the Video version .
Apple released the program in response to complaints that it had not taken necessary measures to prevent hearing loss in iPod users .
In California , a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple in January over claims of hearing loss from iPod use .
Apple 's worldwide vice-president of marketing for the iPod , Greg Joswiak , indicated that this patch is available for people who want " an easy-to-use option to set their own personal volume limit . "
It is available for free download .
The software also has the option of being used with parental controls to prevent children from modifying the volume .
iPods sold in France already have the volume limited , as the law forbids a sound louder than 100 decibels ( dB ) .
