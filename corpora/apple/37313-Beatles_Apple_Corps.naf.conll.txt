Beatles ' Apple Corps sues Apple Computer
March 28 , 2006
The Beatles ' Apple Corps has filed a lawsuit against computer and electronics maker Apple Computer in a London court this week , the third such lawsuit in a long running trademark dispute between the two companies .
Apple Corps claims that Apple Computer 's iTunes Music Store violates an agreement reached between the two companies in 1991 , which barred Apple Computer from using the " Apple " brand in certain uses in the music business .
The trial is set to begin on Wednesday in the Royal Courts of Justice , located in central London .
Presiding Judge Martin Mann has stated that he owns an iPod portable music player , which is made by Apple Computer and marketed alongside the iTunes Music Store .
Apple Corps has twice before sued Apple Computer over its use of the " Apple " name .
The first lawsuit was settled out of court in 1981 , with the young computer maker paying $ 80,000 and agreeing to stay out of the music business .
In the late 1980 's Apple Computer added audio recording abilities to its Macintosh computers , prompting Apple Corps to file suit again in 1989 .
That lawsuit was settled in 1991 , also out of court , with Apple paying $ 26.5 million .
