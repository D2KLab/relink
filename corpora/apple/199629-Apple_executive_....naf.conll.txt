Apple executive leaves company after iPhone 4 antenna issues
August 9 , 2010
Mark Papermaster , formerly an Apple Inc. executive overseeing hardware engineering for the company 's iPhone , is stepping down from his post .
The move came after Apple received criticism last month for the placement of the antenna on their most recent iPhone model , iPhone 4 .
Apple confirmed that Papermaster , 49 , had left the company , but did not say whether he decided to leave or was forced out .
Papermaster did not comment on the situation .
According to The New York Times , who first broke the news about Papermaster 's departure , an anonymous individual " with direct knowledge of the situation " claimed that the former executive had been ousted over various hardware issues , some related to the iPod Touch .
When Apple CEO Steve Jobs first introduced iPhone 4 , he praised the device 's antenna design .
However , many consumers reported that , when holding the phone in a certain location , reception would decrease and sometimes lead to dropped calls .
Apple 's response to the issue , dubbed " Antennagate " by the media , was first to recommend holding the phone in a different location .
