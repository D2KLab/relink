Cisco sues Apple for iPhone trademark
January 12 , 2007
The iPhone only made its appearance as a prototype and there have been controversies aroused .
The dispute has come up between the manufacturer of the iPhone ( which was resented on Wednesday for the first time ) - Apple Inc. - and a leader in network and communication systems , based in San Jose - Cisco .
The company claims to possess the trademark for iPhone , and moreover , that it sells devices under the same brand through one of its divisions .
This became the reason for Cisco to file a lawsuit against Apple Inc. so that the latter would stop selling the device .
Cisco states that it has received the trademark in 2000 , when the company overtook Infogear Technology Corp., which took place in 1996 .
The Vice President and general counsel of the company , Mark Chandler , explained that there was no doubt about the excitement of the new device from Apple , but they should not use a trademark , which belongs to Cisco .
The iPhone developed by Cisco is a device which allows users to make phone calls over the voice over Internet protocol ( VoIP ) . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
