Apple plans to sell movies on iTunes
June 20 , 2006
Apple Computer is planning to sell full-length feature films for download via the online iTunes Music Store .
The store currently sells digital music tracks , and more recently has begun to sell TV episodes .
Apple executives are in negotiations with film studios to arrange the deal and settle on pricing structures .
It is expected that films will retail for around $ 9.99 US dollars , although some studios are reported to want to set a higher price .
iTunes is currently by the biggest online retailer of digital music , with its software tightly integrated with the popular iPod line of products .
Newer versions of the iPod include a colour screen capable of displaying videos , and so consumers could watch the films on the devices , but it is not yet clear how many people will want to do this .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs is also the largest single shareholder of Disney , which now owns animation studio Pixar , however he could end up playing a wider role within the film industry if iTunes becomes the dominant online distributor .
A full-length TV movie , ' High School Musical Sources ' from Disney , is already available on iTunes , suggesting that the technical infrastructure is already in place . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
