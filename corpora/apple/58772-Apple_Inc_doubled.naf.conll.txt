Apple Inc. doubled its profits
January 18 , 2007
The American computer company Apple has reached 78 percent increase in its profits during the last quarter , which ended December 30 , 2006 .
This fact is explained by great demand enjoyed by Apple 's iPod digital music players during the Christmas and New Year sales period .
As a result of successful Christmas sales , the very beginning of the financial year marked a double increase of the Apple 's sales if compared to the $ 565 million profit reaped during the same period of the last year .
The company gained the record-breaking $ 1 billion .
The overall annual revenue of the company made up $ 7.1 billion in 2006 , having boosted from $ 5.8 billion in 2005 .
The company 's revenue growth is partially explained by the fact that the laptops produced by Apple are also found among the bestsellers .
Even the Wall Street experts have not broadcasted such remarkable results for the Apple computer company .
Apple 's results were way ahead of market expectations .
