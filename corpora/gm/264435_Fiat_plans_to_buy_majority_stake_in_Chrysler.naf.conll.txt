Fiat plans to buy majority stake in Chrysler
May 29 , 2011
Fiat announced on Friday that it intends to purchase the six percent of automaker Chrysler that the US government currently owns , which would give the Italian company a 52 percent majority stake in Chrysler .
According to Fiat 's announcement , the company has told the US Treasury that it intends to use its option to buy the share in Chrysler held by the US government , a deal that will be finalized by June 10 .
If a price is not agreed on by that time , Fiat will pay the average of the estimates of two investment banks .
In 2009 , Fiat bought a twenty percent stake in Chrysler , which had just exited bankruptcy , and has since increased its holding to 46 percent , expected to increase to 57 % by the end of this year .
According to analyst Maryann Keller , the deal is a good one for both companies , as `` n ] either one has the ability to compete alone in the kind of global environment that they face . ''
Analyst Rebecca Lindland said that the move will also benefit the companies by getting `` them out from underneath any hint of government ownership and any of that negativity that went along with the bailout . '' _ENDOFSENTENCE_
