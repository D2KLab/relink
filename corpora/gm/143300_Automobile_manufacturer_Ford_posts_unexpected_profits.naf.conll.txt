November 03 , 2009
The US automobile manufacturer Ford has said that it posted a net profit of US$ 997 million in the third quarter of this year , and predicted that it would be `` solidly profitable '' by 2011 .
The reports surprised most analysts , who had forecast that the auto company would lose money .
Ford 's profits equate to 26 cents per share , a large difference to the 12 cent per share lost that had been anticipated by most economic analysts .
`` Our third-quarter results clearly show Ford is making tremendous progress despite the prolonged economic slump , '' said the firm 's chief executive officer , Alan Mulally .
`` While we still face a challenging road ahead , our transformation is working and our underlying business continues to grow stronger . ''
Mulally predicted that his company would meet or even surpass all of its financial targets , and suggested that the fourth quarter of this year could see it post an operating profit . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
