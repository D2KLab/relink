April 01 , 2009
General Motors Corporation ( GM ) announced on Wednesday that it saw a 45 % drop in United States vehicle sales for its cars in March .
Executives from several auto firms , however , said that there was some hope for the auto industry to stabilise , as car sales rebounded in the last week of March .
`` The market is starting to show small signs of life which need to be nourished like seedlings , '' said the vice president and chairman of Chrysler LLC Jim Press .
`` It 's too early to see a trend , but spring shows signs of hope . ''
Other automobile manufacturers also saw their car sales slip : Chrysler and the Japanese Toyota both reported a 39 % loss , whilst Ford Motor Company sales fell 41 % .
Annualised sales of vehicles in the car industry in the US are predicted to have dipped below nine million in March , compared to February 's 9.12 million , which was the lowest number since 1981 .
`` Auto makers are pulling every lever in their effort to attract buyers , as evidenced by the new programs from Ford and GM .
The typical incentive programs simply do not resonate in today 's economy , '' Jesse Toprak , an analyst for Edmunds .
