GM and Chrysler receive Canadian loans amid US restructuring ultimata
April 03 , 2009
General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler will receive bridge loans from the government of Canada and the provincial government of Ontario , however no more will be forthcoming from either Canadian or US governments unless the companies can reinvent themselves .
`` This is a regrettable but necessary step to protect the Canadian economy .
We are doing this on the assumption that we obviously can not afford either in the United States or Canada a catastrophic short-term collapse . ''
said Stephen Harper , Prime Minister of Canada .
`` We can not , we must not , and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish .
This industry is , like no other , an emblem of the American spirit ; a once and future symbol of America 's success , '' said Barack Obama , President of the United States .
`` These companies - and this industry - must ultimately stand on their own , not as wards of the state . ''
Chrysler will receive CA$ 1 billion and may in fact be eligible for as much as CA$ 4 billion .
