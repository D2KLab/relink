Australian government announces $ 52.5 million financial assistance package for Ford
May 05 , 2006
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and federal industry minister Ian MacDonald today announced that the federal government would be providing Ford Australia with a AU$ 52.5 million ( US$ 40.4 million ) `` financial assistance package '' .
Additional assistance will also be provided by the Victorian state government .
According to Mr Howard , the injection will secure Ford 's manufacturing operations in Australia `` for the long term '' .
From the package , AU$ 40 million will be used for the design and manufacture of Ford 's next model Falcon and Territory vehicles , which will be built in Australia .
Despite being given a major facelift in 2002 and another in 2005 , the Falcon 's bodyshell dates back to 1998 .
The current Falcon will need to serve the company until at least 2007 when the new model is anticipated .
In the meantime , it will face stiff competition from the completely new Holden Commodore ( the Falcon 's major competitor ) which will be released in the second half of this year .
The additional AU$ 12.5 million will be spent on the development of a light commercial vehicle platform , which will be built overseas and marketed to around 80 countries .
