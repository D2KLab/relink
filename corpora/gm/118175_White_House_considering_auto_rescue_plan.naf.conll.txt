White House considering auto rescue plan
December 13 , 2008
After a plan to bail out three large American auto companies failed to pass the Senate this week , the White House has said that it is considering using some of the US$ 700 billion earmarked to rescue the banking industry to bail out the automakers .
The White House says that the collapse of the automakers would be a terrible setback that could destroy the economy .
`` Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms .
However , given the current weakened state of the US economy , we will consider other options if necessary - including use of the TARP Troubled Assets Relief Program ] programme - to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers , '' said Dana Perino , the White House Press Secretary .
`` A precipitous collapse of this industry would have a severe impact on our economy , and it would be irresponsible to further weaken and destabilize our economy at this time . ''
Earlier this week , the `` Big Three '' automakers - Ford , Chrysler , and General Motors - had pleaded before Congress to be given $ 14 billion in funds so as to prevent collapse .
Although the House approved the measures , the Senate voted the proposition down with a vote of 52-35 .
Part of the failure of the bill to pass was due to disagreements over labour cuts , which the Republicans insisted reach parity by next year with those of Japanese carmakers .
