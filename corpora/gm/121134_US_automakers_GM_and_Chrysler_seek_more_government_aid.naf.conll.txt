US automakers GM and Chrysler seek more government aid
February 18 , 2009
The United States auto manufacturer Chrysler , which has been badly affected by the ongoing recession , has asked the US government for an additional US$ 5 billion in aid on top of the four billion it has already received , saying that it plans to fire three thousand employees .
At the end of last year , the auto maker had just over 54,000 employees , meaning that the layoffs will equal about six percent of its total workforce .
In addition , Chrysler will cut the Chrysler Aspen , PT Cruiser , and Durango from production .
Another automaker , General Motors ( GM ) , announced that it seeks $ 16.6 billion in loans from the government , in addition to the $ 13.4 billion that it has already received .
GM plans to lay off 47,000 employees and close five factories .
GM says that it might need as much as $ 30 billion from the US Treasury Department , an increase over their previous estimate of $ 18 billion .
The company has warned that it might run out of money by March if more aid was not given .
Rick Wagoner , GM 's chief executive , described the firm 's plan as `` comprehensive , responsive , achievable , and flexible '' .
