American automobile manufacturer Chrysler LLC has said that it wants to eliminate 789 , or about a quarter , of its 3,200 dealers by early June .
In a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday , the firm stated its network has too many dealers competing between each other and is antiquated .
A June 3 hearing has been scheduled in the US Bankruptcy Court to determine whether the move should be approved .
`` This is a difficult day for us and not a day anybody can be prepared for , '' said Jim Press , the Vice Chairman of Chrysler .
Company executives said the firm is trying to eliminate dealers with poor performances , and retain those who make the strongest sales .
Over 50 % of the dealerships that are to be eliminated sell less than a hundred automobiles per year .
`` We recognize in the short term we will see some loss of sales .
But based on the long term ... the dealer network ] is key and it 's going to be very strong , powerful , with a much better financial viability , '' said Press . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
