Bankruptcy for U.S. automaker GM becomes almost certain after bondholder offers fail
May 28 , 2009
The United States automobile manufacturing firm General Motors announced on Wednesday that most of its bondholders did not exchange GM 's US$ 27 billion debt for a ten percent share in the company 's stock .
The automaker , in financial straits , has a June 1 deadline to finish a government restructuring plan that includes plant closures and other debt reduction measures .
U.S. President Barack Obama 's administration said it would not give more financial aid to the firm unless 90 % of GM 's bondholders would agree on compromises that would significantly reduce the firm 's costs .
`` The principal amount of notes tendered was substantially less than the amount required by GM to satisfy the debt reduction requirement , '' GM said in a statement .
`` They said no .
That 's it .
They tried .
That 's why they 're going to have to file for bankruptcy , '' said a university professor from the University of Michigan who specializes in bankruptcy . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
