Ford announces deep production cuts in response to growing losses
August 19 , 2006
Ford has announced sweeping cuts of 21 % ( 168,000 units ) in its US and Canadian production , resulting in the partial closure of ten of its plants during the fourth quarter .
The measure comes on top of existing turnaround plans announced in January , in which 25,000 to 30,000 positions should be cut and 14 plants closed by 2012 .
Ford is the world 's third-largest automaker and the U.S. 's second-largest .
However it has in recent years been struggling with poor profitability and shrinking market shares .
In 2005 it lost $ 1.6 billion and recently the company reported a second quarter loss of $ 254 million and a 34 % year-year decline in sales for the month of July .
George Pipas , director of sales analysis at Ford , points to rising gas prices having negative impact on the sale of the companies SUV lines as well as its sales leader , the F-series pickup truck as being the direct cause of the latest initiative .
So far the following plants are thought to be affected : * St. Thomas Assembly of St. Thomas , Ontario , Canada * Chicago , Illinois * Wixom Assembly Plant of Wixom , Michigan , Michigan * Louisville Assembly of Louisville , Kentucky * Michigan Truck Plant of Wayne , Michigan * St. Paul , Minnesota * Kansas City Assembly of Kansas City , Missouri * Norfolk Assembly of Norfolk , Virginia * River Rouge Plant of Dearborn , Michigan Ford 's stock fell 17 cents ( 2.1 % ) to $ 8 on the New York Stock Exchange . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
