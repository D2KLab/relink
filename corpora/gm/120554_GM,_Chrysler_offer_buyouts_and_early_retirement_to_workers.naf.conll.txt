GM , Chrysler offer buyouts and early retirement to workers
February 03 , 2009
General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler have both begun to offer layoff packages to their workforces .
The automobile manufacturers have been hard hit in the recent economic downturn and have been forced to seek federal aid from the U.S. government .
Reports say that GM 's package includes a $ 20,000 cash payment and a $ 25,000 new vehicle voucher .
Chrysler will offer a $ 25,000 vehicle voucher and $ 50,000 with healthcare and $ 75,000 without .
Both will offer the deal to most United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union members - 62,000 at GM , which is seeking to cut 31,500 jobs by 2012 .
The two companies have received $ 13.4 billion in federal loans to keep them operating , but Congress required them to produce viability plans to demonstrate they were making significant cost cuts and labor concessions in return for the money .
UAW workers in Detroit earn $ 28 an hour ; their replacements will earn about half that .
The UAW 's `` jobs bank '' , a system where workers without duties are still paid , has stopped at both companies .
