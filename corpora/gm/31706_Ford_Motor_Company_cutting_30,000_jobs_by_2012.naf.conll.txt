The Ford Motor Company , the second-largest car manufacturer in America , will cut 30,000 jobs and 14 plants as part of a restructuring plan to relieve Ford after a US$ 1.6 billion loss last year in North American sales .
The plan , called `` Way Forward '' , the brainchild of Ford 's Chief Executive Officer , William Clay Ford Jr. , is to end Ford 's North American losses by 2008 .
To accomplish this 30,000 jobs which make up 20 to 25 percent of Ford 's North American workforce of 122,000 people will be cut and 14 plants will be closed in order to bring Ford 's production capacity in line with demand .
By the end of this year , the Atlanta and St. Louis plants will be closed .
Atlanta makes the Ford Taurus sedan , which is being phased out .
The St. Louis plant is one of two plants that manufactures the Ford Explorer , whose sales had a 29 % decline in 2005 .
It will also close its Wixom , Michigan plant , Batavia Transmission in Ohio the Windsor Casting plant in Ontario which was previously announced by Ford that it was to be closed after contract negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union .
