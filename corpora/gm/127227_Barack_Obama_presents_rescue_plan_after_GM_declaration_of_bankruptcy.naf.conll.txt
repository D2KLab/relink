Barack Obama presents rescue plan after GM declaration of bankruptcy
June 01 , 2009
In a televised speech from the White House at 16:00 UTC today , President of the United States Barack Obama presented a reorganization plan following the 12:00 UTC announcement by General Motors that it had filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors , the largest bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturing company .
Describing the problem with the company as one that had been `` decades in the making , '' Obama explained the rationale behind his proposed reorganization plan for General Motors .
He stated that his intent was not to `` perpetuate ] the bad business decisions of the past , '' and that loaning General Motors money , when debt was its problem , would have been doing exactly that .
His plan , he stated , was for the United States government , in conjunction with the governments of Canada and Ontario ( which he thanked for their roles alongside the government of Germany which he thanked for its role in selling a corporate stake in GM Europe ) , to become shareholders in General Motors .
The United States government would hold a 60 % stake .
The government will give GM a capital infusion of US$ 30 billion in addition to the funds it has already received .
Of the government ownership he stated that he refused `` to let General Motors and Chrysler become wards of the state '' , and described the bankruptcy of Chrysler , and the bankruptcy of General Motors that he envisioned as being `` quick , surgical , bankruptcies '' .
He pointed to the bankruptcy of Chrysler as an example of what he envision for General Motors , but stated that General Motors was a `` more complex company '' than Chrysler .
