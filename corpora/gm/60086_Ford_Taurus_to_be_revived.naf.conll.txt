Ford Taurus to be revived
February 09 , 2007
thumb Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally has reported that Ford will rename the Ford Five Hundred to the Taurus for the 2008 model year , when a facelifted model is expected to be launched to improve the lackluster sales of the outgoing model .
Mulally says that Ford 's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move , and makes their names easily forgettable .
As a result , Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates , the Taurus being one of them , and the Falcon possibly in the future .
The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in 1986 , and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan , and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit , leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the `` boxy '' cars of the 70s and 80s .
The Taurus survived for four generations , selling over 7,500,000 units .
The Taurus was discontinued in October 2006 , after a brief run of 2007 models destined for fleet customers .
`` How can it go away ? ''
Alan Mulally remembered asking , `` It 's the best-selling car in America . ''
