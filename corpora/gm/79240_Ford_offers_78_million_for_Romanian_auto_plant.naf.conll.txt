Ford offers US$ 78 million for Romanian auto plant
September 08 , 2007
Ford Motor Company , the U.S. car maker , will reportedly pay $ 57 million ( US$ 78 million ) for a 72.4 percent stake in the Romanian assembly plant Automobile Craiova , a Romanian official said Friday .
`` The offer of Ford Motor Company for a 72.4 percent stake is $ 4.1556 per share or $ 57 million overall , '' said Sebastian Vladescu , head of the State Property Agency ( AVAS ) , after opening Ford 's improved offer .
Vladescu added that the contract may be signed on September 12 , during the auto show in Frankfurt .
The Romanian government bought back the Craiova-based car maker from Daewoo Motors , in late 2006 for US$ 51 million .
As the Korean company was bankrupt , the government had to pay another $ 10 million for debts stemming from past loans .
Ford is the only bidder for the purchase of the factory .
According to Washington Post , many auto-part makers have set up in the new European Union member country , attracted by cheap labor , favourable tax rates and the rising output of Renault 's Dacia plant .
The vice president of Dacia , Constantin Stroe , said that the price Ford offers is not important .
