General Motors Corporation ( GM ) has posted its first annual loss since 1992 .
GM reported losing US$ 4.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a total loss of $ 8.6 billion for the entire year .
GM admitted Thursday night that the loss could swell further as it pays pensions and healthcare costs to thousands of former workers .
GM warned that the amount calculated for last year is preliminary and could rise before it is officially reported to the US securities and exchanges commission in March .
The loss was far greater than analysts predicted .
Ford , the second of the big three American car manufacturers , beat predictions earlier in the week .
In contrast , Toyota is expected to report that it will beat last year 's profit of $ 11 billion .
