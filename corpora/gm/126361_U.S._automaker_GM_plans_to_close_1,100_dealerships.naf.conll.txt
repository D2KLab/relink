U.S. automaker GM plans to close 1,100 dealerships
May 15 , 2009
American automobile manufacturer General Motors ( GM ) announced plans Friday to shut down about 1,100 of its dealerships , in an effort to evade bankruptcy and lower its expenditures .
GM 's move comes a day after Chrysler , another U.S. car maker , released a list of 789 dealerships that it was closing .
Unlike Chrylser , GM will not publicly announce the dealerships that it intends to shut down .
Instead , dealerships whose franchises wo n't be renewed after October of next year will receive a private letter telling them of the decision .
At the moment , GM has 6,246 dealers in the U.S. .
It intends to reduce that number to 3,605 by the end of 2010 .
GM said the dealerships that were to be closed are `` underperforming and very small sales volume U.S. dealers . ''
`` They 're dealerships that are in most cases hurting , losing money , and in danger of going out of business anyway , '' said GM 's sales , service , and marketing vice president in a telephone conference .
