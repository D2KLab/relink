US automaker bailout deal fails to pass Senate
December 12 , 2008
A US$ 14 billion bailout package deal for the `` Big Three '' United States automakers -- Chrysler , Ford , and General Motors -- has been rejected in the United States Senate after failing a procedural vote .
The bill was rejected after bipartisan discussions on the bailout broke down when Republican Party leaders insisted that the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union agree to increase wage cuts by next year in order to bring their pay into line with those of Japanese automobile companies in the United States .
The UAW refused to meet the demands .
The final vote count in the Senate was 52-35 , eight short of the 60 needed to pass .
Only ten Republicans joined forty Democrats and two independents in voting for the bill .
Three Democrats voted with thirty-one Republicans against it .
Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said that he was `` terribly disappointed '' by the failure of the bill to pass .
`` I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow .
