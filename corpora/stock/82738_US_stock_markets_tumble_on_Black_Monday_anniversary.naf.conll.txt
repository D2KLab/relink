US stock markets tumble on ` Black Monday ' anniversary
October 20 , 2007
Some say history tends to repeat itself .
Today marked a day in history , when 20 years ago , the United States Dow Jones Industrial Average market crashed , on what is known as ` Black Monday ' .
The crash sent the market tumbling down 508 points , losing nearly 24 % .
On Friday , the Dow Jones nearly broke that record when the market closed at -366.94 points , down almost three percent .
Several factors could be to blame for the loss , one being Turkey 's government approving a measure on October 18 to send Turkish troops into Iraq in an attempt to take out militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) .
This sent oil prices skyrocketing to the highest prices in history , with the highest record being just over US$ 89.00 , which was set on October 18 .
Fears that the housing market in the U.S. has come to a standstill has also lead Caterpillar Inc. , which manufactures and sells construction equipment to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop , and the American economy to be severely hurt .
On Friday their stocks lost nearly six percent to close at $ 73.57 .
