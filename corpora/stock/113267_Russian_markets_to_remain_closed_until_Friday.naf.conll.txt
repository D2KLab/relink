Russian markets to remain closed until Friday
September 18 , 2008
The Russian government has continued to hold all stock markets closed until Friday , including the MICEX and RTS exchanges .
Facing its worst financial crisis since 1989 , the government is fighting to stem off a crash and restore consumer confidence .
President Dmitry Medvedev went on national television to appease the public .
`` There is no more important task for Russian authorities than stability of our financial system under the current circumstances .
This is our top priority , '' Medvedev said .
`` The market should be given all the necessary support . ''
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin announced that 500 billion rubles ( US$ 19.7 billion ) would be infused into the stock markets when they opened on Friday , with half of that amount coming from the federal budget .
In addition , the Central Bank responded by offering to loan an additional 60 billion rubles ( US $ 2.63 billion ) on top of the 1.13 trillion rubles ( US$ 44.6 billion ) that it offered yesterday to Sberbank , VTB Group and Gazprombank .
