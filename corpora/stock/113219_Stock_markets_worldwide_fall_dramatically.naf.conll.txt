The Nasdaq index has fallen by 3.16 % to 2138.14 , while the Dax was 1.75 % lower than the start of the day as of 16:08 UTC .
The Japanese index the Nikkei was one of the few to rise in value over the day .
It ended up 1.2 % , although this follows a large fall in the value of the index when it hit an all time low yesterday .
