Global markets surge in value
October 13 , 2008
Markets worldwide have surged in value following efforts by governments to ease the effect of the ongoing financial crisis , which has recently caused a massive decline in the value of stock markets .
On Sunday , the fifteen countries from the Eurogroup -- that is , those countries which use the euro as official currency -- had agreed on a joint plan to face the crisis , which would consist in supporting financial institutions and by guaranteeing interbank loans .
The Eurogroup meeting was the last of many which took place during the weekend .
The G7 nations had met in Washington at the same time that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank held their Autumn meetings .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index is one of the indexes that have done particularly well today , and it closed up 11.08 % , well over 9,000 points .
General Motors was the best performer in this index , with its value rising by 31.49 % .
The Nasdaq rose by 11.81 % .
The FTSE 100 has today gone up in value by 8,26 % , to take the index back over the four thousand mark .
