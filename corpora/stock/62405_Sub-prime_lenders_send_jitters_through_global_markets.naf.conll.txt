Sub-prime lenders send jitters through global markets
March 13 , 2007
Just two weeks after China sent global markets into a tumble , growing worries about sub-prime mortgage lenders in the United States are sending jitters through stock exchanges around the globe .
The three major US stock market indices each fell two percent from Monday 's closing price , marking the second-biggest loss of 2007 .
London 's FTSE 100 , Paris ' CAC 40 and Frankfurt 's DAX 30 indices each closed down more than 1 percent .
As the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that late payments on mortgages and home foreclosures in the US homes rose in the fourth quarter to their highest level in years , investors are concerned that not only US banks but also multi-national banks around the globe could have exposure .
More than two dozen sub-prime lenders have closed or sold operations as defaults on those mortgages have risen .
`` The delinquencies and defaults have started to soar , '' said Nicolas Retsinas , director of Housing Studies at Harvard University .
`` A lot of these lenders started to make loans and lost track of some of the fundamentals . ''
New Century Financial Corporation , the second largest sub-prime lender in the US , has recently revealed that its creditors were no longer providing funds and , further , it has become subject of an SEC investigation .
