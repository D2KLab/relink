The index fell over 2,000 points in the past nine days to reach its lowest level since 2003 .
The S&P 500 was down more than 7 % .
The U.S. markets opened on the positive side , but with bad news coming from several different areas such as uncertainty over whether the 700 billion USD bank bailout bill passed by the United States House of Representatives and the Senate will be effective .
Concerns over the lack of trading within the credit market was a primary cause of the drop .
This was the seventh straight day of markets closing in severely negative numbers .
