US stocks see 9 % drop before making recovery
May 07 , 2010
US stock markets saw an unusually turbulent day yesterday , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ) losing almost a thousand points in thirty minutes , although later recovered somewhat to end the day with a smaller loss .
The DJIA had its worst fall since 1987 , a drop of 9 % or 998.50 points , before going back up a bit to close with a loss of 3.30 % or 347.80 points to a level of 10,520 .
The Nasdaq fell 82.65 points or 3.44 % , and the Standard & Poor 's 500 index dropped 3.24 % or 37.75 points .
According to some reports , the quick loss happened because a trader mistyped an order to sell a large amount of stock , causing the stock price to go down enough to trigger orders to sell elsewhere in the market .
( By the following day this theory had been abandoned . )
Other reports suggested that the biggest markets `` slowed '' their executions when it became clear that computerized errors were occurring ; as a result , the vast majority of buy orders were briefly withdrawn , allowing the free-fall to continue for several minutes .
Stock for the Procter & Gamble company fell almost 37 % during the sell-off , about 75 minutes to the closing bell .
An investigation started into whether any erroneous trades happened .
