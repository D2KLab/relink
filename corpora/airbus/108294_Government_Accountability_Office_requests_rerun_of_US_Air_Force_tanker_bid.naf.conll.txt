Government Accountability Office requests rerun of US Air Force tanker bid
July 02 , 2008
The Government Accountability Office on June 18 called for a re-run of the bidding for the U.S. Air Force $ 40 billion tanker contract , citing major flaws in the procurement process .
This imperils the Northrop Grumman and EADS North America plan to assemble the planes in Mobile , Alabama .
When the Air Force selected Los Angeles based Northrop Grumman on February 29 to build the aircraft , Boeing challenged the award in a formal protest before the GAO , claiming the evaluation was skewed towards Northrop .
The GAO upheld Boeing 's protest , though not all of their individual claims were upheld .
`` Our review of the record led us to conclude that the Air Force had made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between Boeing and Northrop Grumman , '' said Michael R. Golden , the GAO 's managing associate general counsel for procurement law .
The GAO issued a non-binding recommendation that the Air Force re-open the competition , allow the competitors to submit revised bids , and completely re-evaluate the new bids .
This process could take a year or more to complete .
The Air Force has 60 days to respond to the GAO . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
