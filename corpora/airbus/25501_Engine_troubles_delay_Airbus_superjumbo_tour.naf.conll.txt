Engine troubles delay Airbus superjumbo tour
November 05 , 2005
The departure from France of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo airliner on a tour of Asia and Australia has been delayed , leading to a rearrangement of its public appearances .
Citing `` a precautionary measure '' , Airbus announced that two of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on the prototype airliner would be replaced before the tour commenced .
Singapore will remain the airliner 's first stop , where Singapore Airlines will display the aircraft they intend to launch into passenger-carrying service in November 2006 .
It is expected that the Airbus 380 will wear the livery of Singapore Airlines when it arrives on November 11 , three days later than originally planned .
The massive airliner will then bypass the planned stop in Malaysia , and fly directly to Sydney , then Melbourne and Brisbane as part of the leadup to Qantas ' 85th birthday celebrations on November 16 .
Qantas plans to commence A380 operations starting in April 2007 .
The Malaysia visit will be rescheduled for November 17 , occurring during the return flight to France .
It is unclear whether the originally planned Australian tour dates can be kept , and sources indicate that the airliner 's first stop in Brisbane , on November 11 , maybe eliminated in favour of a brief appearance on November 16 . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
