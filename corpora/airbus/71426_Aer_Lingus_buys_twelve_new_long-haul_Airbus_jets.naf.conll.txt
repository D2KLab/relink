June 09 , 2007
Irish national airline Aer Lingus have purchased 12 new long-haul Airbus aircraft as a means of modernising it 's long-haul fleet and improving it 's transatlantic network .
Under the agreement , Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will receive six new A330-300E aircraft from 2009 to 2011 , then between 2014 and 2016 it will take delivery of six new A350 XWB ( Extra Wide Body ) aircraft , a new design currently under development by Airbus .
Aer Lingus also have options of six more A350s to exercise by 2018 .
Aer Lingus already operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 30 short-haul aircraft ( 24 A320s and 6 A321s ) and eight long-haul A330s , and had made the purchase of new long-haul airliners a top priority since the formerly state-owned company was floated on British and Irish stock markets in September 2006 .
The airline had approached Airbus rival Boeing regarding a potential deal for their new 787 aircraft , but Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion stated that he believed the Airbus aircraft were `` better on fuel and better on range '' than the 787 .
He also said that , although the aircraft have a catalogue value of $ 1.78 billion ( US$ 2.4 billion ) , Airbus had offered them at an `` exceptional discounts '' on them .
Some of the A330s will be replaced by the new aircraft .
As well as new routes to the US , Mannion stated that there was a possibility of routes elsewhere resulting from the new aircraft as well , saying , `` We will prioritize the U.S. ( but ) we have an eye as to what 's happening to the Far East and South Africa . ''
