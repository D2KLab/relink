Internal emails expose Boeing-Air Force contract discussions
November 24 , 2004
Emails exchanged among United States Air Force officials regarding a USD$ 23 billion dollar deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing have been entered into the public record .
Senator John McCain ( R-AZ ) entered them into the Congressional Record during a speech last week against the now-cancelled deal to lease 100 mid-air tanker aircraft from Boeing .
Congressional lawmakers rejected the proposal in October , although industry experts say the deal had been killed by the Pentagon because of reports stating that the deal had favored Boeing .
Senator McCain has been the deal 's most vocal critic .
The original negotiations with Boeing were over a no-bid contract .
Such contracts are often justified by the speed they offer , eliminating a preliminary bid and selection round that may last months .
However , no-bid contracts are only open to the company selected by the procuring agency .
This leaves no-bid contracts open to accusations of conflicts of interest among the procurement personnel .
