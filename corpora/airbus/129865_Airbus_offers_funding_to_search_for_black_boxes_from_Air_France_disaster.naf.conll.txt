Airbus offers funding to search for black boxes from Air France disaster
July 30 , 2009
Airbus have announced that they will be willing to contribute between $ 12 million and $ 20 million ( about US$ 16 million to $ 28 million ) to fund an extended search for the black boxes from Air France Flight 447 .
The Airbus A330 jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June , killing all 228 people on board .
Chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement , `` We want to know what happened , as improving air safety is our top priority .
We are fully committed to support the extension of the search with a significant contribution . ''
Although airframers normally supply technical assistance to investigations , the required impartiality makes funding rare , with Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath saying the company 's move was unprecedented .
`` This is an exceptional accident and an exceptional situation , '' Schaffrath explained .
France 's investigative agency BEA has requested financial assistance for the search from both Airbus and Air France .
Air France have discussed this possibility with the BEA .
