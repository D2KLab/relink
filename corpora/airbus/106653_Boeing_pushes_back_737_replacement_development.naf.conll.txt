Boeing pushes back 737 replacement development
May 24 , 2008
United States airframer Boeing has announced that development of a replacement for their 737 narrowbody airliner , begun two years ago , has been pushed back several years , Boeing saying that further advancement of technology is required .
Spokeswoman Sandy Angers said that that the team formed to look at the development had been merged into the parent product development team and would cease looking at specific designs .
Boeing say airlines demand performance improvements of 15-20 % are required if a new airliner is to be commercially viable .
`` We 've reduced our airplane-design effort and are focusing more on the technology breakthroughs , '' said Angers .
`` We need technology breakthroughs in engines , aerodynamics , materials and other systems .
You ca n't simply shrink the 787 and expect the same benefits for the narrow-body market .
We 've got difficult challenges . ''
One important difference is that the plastic composite used for the fuselage of the 787 would not offer as significant a weight saving on a smaller aircraft .
