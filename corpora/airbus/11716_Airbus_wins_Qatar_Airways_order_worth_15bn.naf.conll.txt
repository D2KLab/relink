Airbus wins Qatar Airways order worth $ 15bn
June 13 , 2005
European aircraft manufacturer , Airbus , has won an order from Qatar Airways for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A350 jets .
The order , which is believed to be worth $ 15 billion , has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show , which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing .
Qatar Airways , which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing 's 787 , will also purchase 20 of Boeing 's larger 777 planes for $ 4.6 billion .
Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus ' massive new A380 's which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of London Heathrow .
In 2004 , Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever , sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market .
However thus far , Boeing has received far more orders than Airbus in 2005 . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
