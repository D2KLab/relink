Boeing delivers final 717 to AirTran , ending Douglas era
May 29 , 2006
Boeing Commercial Airplanes on Tuesday delivered the final 717 jet built to AirTran Airways in ceremonies in Long Beach , California , bringing production of McDonnell Douglas jets to an end .
`` AirTran Airways would like to thank the many Boeing employees for their hard work and dedication over the years and enabling us to build a world-class aircraft fleet that is unparalleled in the aviation industry , '' said Joe Leonard , Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of AirTran Airways .
The final Boeing 717 was the 15,599 th plane built by the Long Beach plant , the original home of Douglas Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas .
It also marked the end of the popular DC-9 family of jets , which has sold over 2,400 units over its 41-year history .
In 1995 , McDonnell Douglas introduced the MD-95 , which later became the Boeing 717 when McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1996 .
The 717 had suffered from slow sales throughout its history , with 155 planes ordered .
In January 2005 , Boeing announced that it would cancel the 717 program after completing all outstanding orders .
The 717 program 's demise leaves the C-17 military cargo jet as the only remaining jet aircraft built in California .
