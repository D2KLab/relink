Airbus launches world 's largest passenger plane
January 18 , 2005
In a ceremony attended by several European political leaders and 5,000 VIP guests , Airbus unveiled plans for the A380 , a twin-deck aircraft that can carry up to 840 people in all-economy class ( 550 for a Boeing 747 ) , or 555 people in typical three mixed classes layout .
The new aircraft will take the world 's - largest title away from rival Boeing 's 747 .
Boeing 's upcoming new design , the 7e7 , does not attempt to compete directly with the A380 but instead is aimed at a more efficient and comfortable flight at 200-250 seats .
Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard stated that he expected sales of the aircraft to exceed the 250 required for the project to break even .
To date , 149 confirmed orders for the aircraft have been received .
Airbus has hopes that sales will exceed 700 .
The company is currently in talks with China regarding possible sales there .
The first test flight of the aircraft may take place as early as March , and the first commercial flight is expected to take off in mid-2006 from Singapore 's Changi Airport .
