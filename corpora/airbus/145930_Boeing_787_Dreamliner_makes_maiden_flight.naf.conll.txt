Boeing 787 `` Dreamliner '' makes maiden flight
December 16 , 2009
Boeing 's newest commercial aircraft , the 787 `` Dreamliner '' , made its first test flight Tuesday in Everett , Washington at 18:00 UTC .
Boeing claims that the new 290 + seat wide-body , twin engine jetliner is more fuel efficient than previous Boeing models .
The release of the `` Dreamliner '' is almost two and a half years behind schedule .
The project has been plagued by various issues , including strike action , parts shortages and design problems .
The aircraft is thought to have attracted 840 orders to date , though some have been cancelled due to the delays , making the 787 worth in the region of US$ 140bn ( $ 96bn , # 86bn ) for Boeing .
An aerospace analyst , Richard Aboulafia , said that `` The test flight ] will provide a badly needed perception that the program is on some kind of schedule again , but it 's still a long way from the ultimate result . ''
Boeing 's European rival , Airbus , is preparing to release a similar aircraft , the A350 , in 2013 . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
