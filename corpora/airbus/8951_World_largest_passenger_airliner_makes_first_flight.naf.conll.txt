April 27 , 2005
The A380 was revealed in January 2005
The world 's largest passenger aircraft , the Airbus A380 , has made its maiden flight after lifting off from Toulouse in France .
The take-off , at 08:30 UTC , was apparently normal and took place exactly on time .
The aircraft flew into clear blue skies with a flight crew of six ( all wearing parachutes as a safety precaution ) and twenty tonnes of test equipment on board .
Around 50,000 people watched the maiden flight , many sitting on grass banks lining the runway .
More people watched the flight on a giant screen erected in the centre of Toulouse .
The test flight lasted four hours , with the aircraft flying no higher than 10,000 nor further than 100 miles from Toulouse as it circled the Bay of Biscay .
The A380 , known for many years during its development phase as the Airbus A3XX , will be the largest airliner in the world by a substantial margin when it enters service .
