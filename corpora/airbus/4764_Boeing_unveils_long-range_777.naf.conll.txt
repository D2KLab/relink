Boeing unveils long-range 777
February 17 , 2005
Boeing has unveiled a new ultra-long range version of its 777 airliner , capable of flying from London to Sydney non-stop .
The 777-200LR can fly for 9,420 nautical miles ( 17,446 kilometers ) with 301 passengers onboard , giving it a range greater than any other airliner in the world .
The aircraft can fly from New York to Singapore and from Los Angeles to Dubai with a full passenger and luggage load non-stop , and has been named the Worldliner by Boeing to mark the fact it can connect almost any two cities on Earth .
Although it can fly from London to Sydney non-stop , the 777-200LR will have to break its return journey to refuel due to direction of the prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere .
So far , Boeing has received five orders from two customers for the 777-200LR since it was announced in February 2000 .
The first of the new airliner will be delivered to Pakistan International Airlines in January 2006 .
EVA Airways is the other launch customer .
First flight is scheduled in early March .
