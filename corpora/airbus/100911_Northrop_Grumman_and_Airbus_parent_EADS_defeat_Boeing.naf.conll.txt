March 01 , 2008
Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent company European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company EADS N.V. ( EADS ) have unexpectedly defeated Boeing for a US$ 40 billion ( GB # 20.1 billion ) contract to supply the United States Air Force ( USAF ) with 179 new aerial refueling tankers at a rate of 15 a year .
It is the biggest contract of its kind since the Joint Strike Fighter program .
That contract was fought for between Boeing and Lockheed Martin , Lockheed ultimately winning the contest .
JSA Research defence analysist Paul Nesbit said that Maintenance , Repair and Overhaul ( MRO ) operations across the aircraft 's fifty-year service life could push the value of the contract as high as US$ 100 billion .
Northrop Grumman CEO Ron Sugar said in an interview `` Everyone told us we were crazy , that we had no chance .
But we took a big swing and in this case , we hit a home run . ''
USAF officials said that the contract had been awarded based on competence , track record and competitive pricing , with UBS analyst David Strauss saying `` The key decision was the amount of fuel the bigger plane could carry .
In the armed services , you can never have too much gas in the air . ''
