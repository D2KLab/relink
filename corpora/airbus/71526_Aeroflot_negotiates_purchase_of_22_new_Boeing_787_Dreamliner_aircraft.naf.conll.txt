Aeroflot negotiates purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft
June 10 , 2007
Russian flag carrier Aeroflot has negotiated the purchase of 22 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners , an aircraft Boeing currently has under development .
The first jets will be delivered in 2014 .
The Dreamliner will be the first commercial jet to be manufactured mainly with carbon-fiber composites instead of the aluminium previously used .
The deal was announced during a large business forum that President Vladimir Putin had set up to showcase his country 's role in the international market .
The deal was the centrepiece of the event .
The sale is the result of a deal begun between Aeroflot and Chicago-based Boeing last year , but negotiations had stalled due to worsening relations between the US and Russia .
Aeroflot has suffered as a result of the delay .
If had the sale gone through last year , the aircraft would have been delivered by 2011 .
