A380 makes maiden flight to US
March 19 , 2007
The Airbus A380 , the world 's largest passenger plane , was set to land in the United States of America on Monday after a test flight .
One of the A380s is flying from Frankfurt to Chicago via New York ; the airplane will be carrying about 500 people .
It is being billed as the first time it has carried a near-normal number of passengers , though most will be staff of Airbus and German airline Lufthansa .
A second A380 is also travelling to the U.S. on Monday , but without passengers .
This will be branded as a Qantas flight and fly from Frankfurt to Los Angeles LAX airport .
The first leg of the flight going towards New York will be travelling under a Lufthansa flight number , and is due to arrive at New York 's John F. Kennedy airport at 12:30 EST ( 16:30 UTC ) .
The test flights are being used to monitor everything from how easily the plane docks at the terminal gate to the way the in-flight dining and entertainment services work .
Deliveries to Singapore Airlines , its launch customer , are not due until October - two years late .
