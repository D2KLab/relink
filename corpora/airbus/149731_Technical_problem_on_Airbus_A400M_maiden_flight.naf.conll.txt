Technical problem on Airbus A400M maiden flight
January 25 , 2010
Airbus has confirmed that there was a software glitch on its Airbus A400M military transplort plane 's maiden flight .
The problem was relatively minor , and affected the software controlling its engines .
The glitch was not reported when the plane made its maiden flight on 11 December -- four years behind schedule and $ 7.3 billion over budget , due to what the manufacturers call `` political interference '' -- and only became public attention this weekend , when German magazine Der Spiegel cited confidential documents from engine maker Europrop in a report .
The steering computer and backup system failed after thirty minutes .
The issue has been resolved , according to Airbus spokesman Jaime Perez-Guerra .
Apparently , the glitch led the pilots to disengage an engine , allowing its blades to turn freely .
Since then , he says , the plane has flown for nearly thirty hours and is exceeding expectations .
However , additional costs were involved , and European aerospace contractor EADS wants this cost to be shouldered by the seven customer nations : Belgium , France , Germany , Luxembourg , Spain , Turkey , and the United Kingdom .
