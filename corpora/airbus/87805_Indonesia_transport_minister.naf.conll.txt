Indonesia 's transport minister tells airlines not to buy European aircraft due to EU ban
December 20 , 2007
Jusman Syafii Djamal , minister of transport for Indonesia , has recommended that local airlines should not purchase aircraft from European manufacturers , such as Airbus .
It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union ( EU ) to add all 51 of Indonesia 's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU .
The EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country , including two major disasters this year - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 , which killed 102 and 21 people respectively .
`` We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked , '' Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying , although Xinhua translated the quote as : `` As long as the ban is still in place , it is better we do not buy aircraft ] from Europe . ''
`` If aircraft are purchased and registered as Indonesian in Europe ] , we are worried the planes wo n't be able to fly to Indonesia because Indonesian airlines ' aircraft are banned from flying over Europe , '' he continued .
Djamal is concerned that instead new European planes would have to be flown into Indonesia prior to registration , with higher costs incurred as a result .
The announcement , which had already been issued to airlines two weeks ago , was made at a joint press conference with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla in Jakarta .
Djamal told reporters that he felt the best option was the lifting of the ban .
