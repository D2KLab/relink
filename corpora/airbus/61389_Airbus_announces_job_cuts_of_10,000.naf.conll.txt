Airbus announces job cuts of 10,000
February 28 , 2007
150px Airbus , Europe 's biggest aircraft manufacturer , has announced 10,000 job cuts over the next four years .
The news comes as its parent company , EADS starts a major restructuring programme because the company is not efficient enough .
Louis Gallois , the Airbus chief executive , said the company expects to cut approximately 4,300 jobs in France , 3,700 in Germany , 1,600 in UK and 400 in Spain .
About half of those cuts will be made among subcontractors and temporary workers .
Actual Airbus employee reduction would be about 5,000 , or 9 % of the total European work force of 55,000 full-time Airbus employees .
Although Gallois said he hoped to achieve this mainly through attrition , the unions were displeased .
Union officials said nearly 14,000 employees at four French sites had a two hour work stoppage Wednesday afternoon to protest the cuts .
`` The response has been massive , '' said Julien Talavan , a spokesman for Force Ouvri√®re , the main Airbus union in France .
