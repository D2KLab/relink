Singapore Airlines to be compensated for A380 delays
October 05 , 2006
Singapore Airlines says that it will be compensated by Airbus for the additional delay in delivery of its new superjumbo A380 's .
The double-deck commercial aircrafts ' delivery , originally due later this year , will be delayed until October 2007 .
The main fault has been found to be problems in the aircraft 's 500km of wiring .
In a statement on the Airbus website , the company said that `` the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital mock-up , which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation , was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve '' .
Airbus is currently two years behind schedule .
In a statement , SIA said that , `` The delays are disappointing ; all the more so because the flight test and certification programme is proceeding well , and the delays are down to production issues . ''
Analysts are predicting that the compensations could well run into a few hundred million US dollars .
SIA has stated that the compensation details will be kept confidential Singapore Airlines is the first airline to fly the A380 and will be receiving the first four aircraft . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
