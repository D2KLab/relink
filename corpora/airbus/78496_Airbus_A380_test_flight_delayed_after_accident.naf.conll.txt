Airbus A380 test flight delayed after accident
September 01 , 2007
A test flight of the new Airbus A380 superjumbo , the largest passenger jet in the world , was delayed today after a superficial accident at Suvarnabhumi Airport , which serves Bangkok , Thailand .
The minor accident occurred during push back , as the aircraft was leaving a parking space before it was due to fly to Chiang Mai International Airport .
As the jet was being pushed back by a Thai Airways International tug operator , the left winglet struck the side of the hangar , and was crumpled against it .
The winglets , designed to improve fuel efficiency , are non-vital parts .
After an inspection , Airbus decided to remove both winglets and continue the flight without them .
The plane left four hours after its scheduled 9:45 a.m. local time departure , carrying 150 passengers .
The flight was intended to counteract criticisms that the massive airliner , which has a 79-metre wingspan , is too big ( and thus too complex for ground crews ) to be practically operated at most airports .
It also demonstrates continuing problems at Suvarnabhumi airport , which has suffered various incidents since it opened last September , the most severe of which being the discovery of large cracks in airport taxiways shortly after opening .
