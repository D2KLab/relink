It was a milestone in aviation history : the first Airbus A380 landed at Singapore 's Changi International Airport at 6:40 p.m. ( GMT +8 ) after a 12-hour flight from Airbus ' Delivery Center .
The aircraft was greeted by some 400 guests , including the Prime Minister of Singapore , Mr. Lee Hsien Loong , at the soon-to-open Terminal 3 of Changi International Airport .
In his speech , the Prime Minister applauded Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) - the recipient carrier - and cited its success as a source of pride for all Singaporeans .
He also said that the landing was a milestone not only for SIA , but also for Changi International Airport , the country 's main airport .
All existing terminals are currently A380-ready , and the SGD1.75-billion Terminal 3 will open its doors in January next year .
The A380 will make a special charity flight on October 25 from Singapore to Sydney and will begin regular service on the Singapore-Sydney route on October 28 . _ENDOFSENTENCE_
